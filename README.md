# ASD-Diagnose-with-GNNs

This repository includes four GNN models of ASD Diagnose: GCN, GAT, ChebyNet and graphSAGE, two plotting codes and the MWU test code. The Python file ending with loss is the model that introduces the Wasserstein Graph Distance.

Both CPU and GPU environments are supported.

## Requirements

Recommended version:

* **Python**: python 3.7 
* **torch**: torch 1.12.0
